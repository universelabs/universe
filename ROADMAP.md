## Project Overview

Universe Labs' mission is to become the world's largest open source key management network.

## Goals

- [ ] Decentralized Login (DLI) - Make login as secure as public key encryption and easier to use than passwords.
- [ ] Become the largest blockchain agnostic key management network.
- [ ] Offer the best UX for DApp key management.
- [ ] Build and maintain software and a peer-to-peer protocol for handling transactions across the network.
- [ ] Build a large community of open source developers who contribute and integrate Universe's API & SDK.

## Execution to date (5 sprints)

#### Universe Key Management Software
- [x] Web App (v1.0.1-alpha.1) - Key management interface where users can sign up and use the copy/paste functionality to recover a Blockstack account.
- [x] Key Management Server & Storage (v1.0.0-alpha) - Universe's key management server and storage/keystore built in Go.

#### Universe Mobile Device
- [x] Mobile Device (v0.3.1-alpha) – A tiny Bluetooth device that caches a user's vault, acting as its decryption key to serve the web app.

#### Universe Stationary Node
- [x] Stationary Node (v0.1.1-alpha) – A "home node" that will be used as cold storage, either locally or by interacting with a decentralized peer-to-peer storage swarm.

#### Universe Frontend Software
- [x] Universe Meta (v1.7.8) - A front-end blockchain framework w/ 5,000+ downloads.


## Development Milestones (unordered list)

- [ ] Universe Key Management - Finish building out authentication on the key management web client.
- [ ] Universe Network - Cosmos-SDK blockchain for the Universe Network.
- [ ] Universe Growth - A code snippet that developers can use to integrate DLI. 
- [ ] Universe Growth - Hackathons to get developers building on Universe DLI.
- [ ] Universe Peer-to-Peer Storage - Design and develop a peer-to-peer storage system for decentralization of keys.
