## Project Overview

Universe Labs' mission is to become the largest open source node and key management network.

## Goals

- [ ] Become the largest blockchain agnostic edge/node and key management network.
- [ ] Offer the best UX for dApp on-boarding and key management software.
- [ ] Build and maintain a required protocol for handling transactions across the network.
- [ ] Build a large community of open source developers contributing and building node modules and apps on the Universe node network.

## Execution to date (1 sprint)

#### Universe Protocol (Blockchain)
- [x] Universe Testnet v0.1.0-alpha. (Universe daemon & CLI).
- [x] One-line Install script (Linux).

#### Universe Key Management / Node Software
- [x] Universe Key Managemet Express/React Web App v0.6.0-alpha.
- [x] Universe Meta Front-end Framework v1.2.0.

## Milestones (unordered list)

- [ ] Universe Key Management - Finish building out the key management web client.
- [ ] Universe Core - Universe Testnet v0.2.0-alpha (improving the design of the network for performance at the edges of the network).
- [ ] Universe Core - Image Builder for Raspberry Pi's.
- [ ] Universe Growth - Raspberry Pi hackathons to get developers building on Universe nodes.
- [ ] Universe Node - Launch the first Universe node device.
- [ ] Universe Growth - Distribute Universe nodes to dApp developers and dApp users.
- [ ] Universe Protocol - Design and develop a protocol that suites the needs of the developers and users.

## Current Tech Stack

[â€º Universe Status](https://github.com/universelabs/universe#status) for the lastest status of the Universe Tech Stack and dependencies.

* Blockstack Auth
* Raspian Linux
* Raspberry Pi Hardware
* Node
* Express
* React
* Universe Meta (Universe's blockchain front-end framework)

## Discovery
We have been polling and collecting data off and on for the past 2 months, talking to decentralized app developers on what issues they are facing the most.

- Users find it difficult to manage their keys.
- Develepers have a hard time on-boarding users and/or keeping users.
- Users do not want to go through the long process to sign up for an app.

We've taken these findings to develop a strategy to assist decentralized systems in adoption.

## Use Cases

#### Examples of what the network can be used for

- [ ] Similarly to the AOL in the 90's, On-board users with node devices that are always on device.
- [ ] User's key management to access all the blockchain networks.
- [ ] Compute, storage, bandwidth, staking, etc.
