# Universe Hardware Roadmap

## Introduction
Universe Labs will be releasing a series of open hardware products that don't collect data on their users.  Our hardware will have a release cadence similar to that of Open Source software, with rapid iterations to improve the product.  

## Node
The universe node is a simple, wirelessy-connected device that is use to access blockchain networks and keep their private keys.  

## Box
The Universe "box" serves as either a TV box, or MiniPC depending on what software is installed.  It is also capable of connecting to multiple blockchain networks and serving as a full node.  

## Router
The Universe Router is a high-performance, 100% open home router.  In addition to routing, the Universe Router is capable of connecting to blockchain networks and distributed systems.  The user has full control of the software running on the router at all times.  

## Laptop
The Universe Laptop is a 100% open, carefully engineered laptop that is built with the needs of users in mind.  

## Smartphone
The universe smartphone is a mobile device that is not monetized by tracking its users.  As such, it will run neither Android nor iOS.
